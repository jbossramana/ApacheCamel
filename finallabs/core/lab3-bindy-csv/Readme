Bindy

The goal of this component is to allow the parsing/binding of non-structured data (or to be more precise non-XML data)
to/from Java Beans that have binding mappings defined with annotations. Using Bindy, you can bind data from sources such as :

CSV records,

Fixed-length records,

FIX messages,

or almost any other non-structured data

MOVE AND DELETE OPERATIONS

file://data?move=.done
file://data?delete=true

pre move and the regular move:
file://data?preMove=inprogress&move=.done


we want to move the file into a backup folder with todayâ€™s date as the pattern, we can do:

move=backup/${date:now:yyyyMMdd}/${file:name}
